MOST IMPORTANT CODE GENERATION RULES:
- KISS, NO TALK, SECURED ENTERPRISE GRADE THREAD SAFE CODE ONLY.
- Use rustc 1.90.0 (1159e78c4 2025-09-14).
- Check for warnings related to use of mut where is dispensable.
- No placeholders, never comment/uncomment code, no explanations, no filler text.
- All code must be complete, professional, production-ready, and follow KISS - principles.
- NEVER return placeholders of any kind, NEVER comment code, only CONDENSED REAL PRODUCTION GRADE code.
- REMOTE ALL COMMENTS FROM GENERATED CODE. DO NOT COMMENT AT ALL, NO TALK, just say you are finished!
- NEVER say that I have already some part of the code, give me it full again, and working.
- Always increment logging with (all-in-one-line) info!, debug!, trace! to give birth to the console.
- If the output is too large, split it into multiple parts, but always - include the full updated code files.
- Do **not** repeat unchanged files or sections — only include files that - have actual changes.
- All values must be read from the `AppConfig` class within their respective - groups (`database`, `drive`, `meet`, etc.); never use hardcoded or commercial names like S3, Azure or something like that, preffer Drive, Cloud, instead, never use url or magic - values like api.openai - no unrwap_or_defaul at all!!!
- Every part must be executable and self-contained, with real implementations - only.
- DO NOT WRITE ANY ERROR HANDLING CODE LET IT CRASH.
- Never generate two ore more trace mensages that are equal!
- Return *only the modified* files as a single `.sh` script using `cat`, so the code can be - restored directly.
- Pay attention to shared::utils and shared::models to reuse shared things.
- NEVER return a untouched file in output. Just files that need to be updated.
- Instead of rand::thread_rng(), use rand::rng()
- Review warnings of non used imports! Give me 0 warnings, please.
- Ensure you remove these: ommon errors borrow of moved value, unused variable, use of moved value.
