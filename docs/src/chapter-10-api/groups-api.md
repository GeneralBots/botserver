# Groups API

The Groups API provides endpoints for managing groups and organizations through Zitadel integration.

## Overview

Groups in BotServer represent organizations in Zitadel. They provide multi-tenant support and user grouping capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### Zitadel Integration

All group operations are proxied to Zitadel:
- Groups map to Zitadel organizations
- Members are managed through Zitadel's org API
- Permissions inherited from Zitadel roles

### Data Model

Groups are not stored in BotServer's database. All data comes from Zitadel:
- Group metadata from Zitadel orgs
- Membership from Zitadel org members
- Permissions from Zitadel policies

## Error Responses

All endpoints may return standard error responses:

```json
{
  "error": "Group not found",
  "code": "GROUP_NOT_FOUND",
  "status": 404
}
```

Common error codes:
- `GROUP_NOT_FOUND` - Group doesn't exist
- `UNAUTHORIZED` - User lacks permission
- `MEMBER_EXISTS` - User already in group
- `MEMBER_NOT_FOUND` - User not in group
- `ZITADEL_ERROR` - Upstream service error

## Permissions

Group operations require appropriate Zitadel permissions:
- **Create**: Organization admin
- **Update**: Organization owner or admin
- **Delete**: Organization owner
- **List**: Authenticated user
- **View Members**: Group member
- **Add/Remove Members**: Group admin

## Rate Limiting

Group endpoints are rate-limited:
- 100 requests per minute for read operations
- 20 requests per minute for write operations

## Best Practices

1. **Cache Group Data**: Groups change infrequently
2. **Batch Operations**: Use bulk endpoints when available
3. **Handle Zitadel Errors**: Gracefully handle upstream failures
4. **Validate Permissions**: Check user has required role
5. **Audit Changes**: Log all group modifications
