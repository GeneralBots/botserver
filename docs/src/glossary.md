# Glossary

## A
**Answer Mode** - Configuration that determines how the bot responds to user queries (direct LLM, with tools, documents only, etc.)

**Argon2** - Password hashing algorithm used for secure credential storage (winner of Password Hashing Competition)

**AST** - Abstract Syntax Tree, the compiled representation of BASIC scripts used for execution

**Authentication Flow** - Process of verifying user identity through credentials and establishing a session

## B
**BASIC** - The scripting language used in .gbdialog files for creating conversational flows

**Bot Authentication** - Process of verifying a bot's credentials before allowing access

**BotSession** - A single conversation instance between a user and bot, maintaining context and history

## C
**Collection** - A group of documents in a knowledge base that are indexed together for semantic search

**Context** - The current state and history of a conversation that influences bot responses

## D
**Dialog** - A conversation script written in BASIC that defines bot behavior and flow

## E
**Embedding** - A vector representation of text used for semantic similarity comparisons

## G
**.gbai** - General Bot Application Interface, the root package containing bot architecture

**.gbdialog** - Package containing BASIC scripts for conversation flows

**.gbkb** - General Bot Knowledge Base, package for document collections and semantic search

**.gbot** - Package containing bot configuration and parameters

**.gbtheme** - Package for UI theming and customization

## K
**Knowledge Base** - A collection of documents that provide contextual information to the bot

## L
**LLM** - Large Language Model, AI system used for generating responses

## M
**MCP** - Model Context Protocol, a standard for tool definitions

**MinIO** - S3-compatible object storage used for file management

## P
**Parameter** - Input definition for tools that specifies type, format, and description

## Q
**Qdrant** - Vector database used for semantic search and embeddings

## S
**Session** - See BotSession

**Session Token** - Unique identifier issued after authentication that validates subsequent requests

**Semantic Search** - Search method that finds content based on meaning rather than just keywords

## T
**Tool** - A function that extends bot capabilities, defined with parameters and BASIC logic

## V
